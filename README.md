## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 2. Generate sample data with injected fraud
python generate_sample_data.py

# 3. Run the app
streamlit run app.py
```

Upload `sample_invoices.csv` and explore the results.

## 🔬 Core Detection Algorithms

### 1. Benford's Law Analysis
**What it does**: Compares the first-digit distribution of all invoice amounts against the
theoretical Benford distribution (P(d) = log₁₀(1 + 1/d)).

**Why it works**: Natural financial data follows Benford's Law. Fraudsters fabricating
invoices tend to choose "random-looking" numbers that produce a *uniform* distribution —
a statistically detectable deviation.

**Implementation**:
- Extract leading digit from each transaction
- Compute Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) vs. expected frequencies
- Chi-square test for conformity
- Flag datasets with MAD > 6% as marginal; > 10% as non-conforming

**Red flag example**: Unusually high frequency of "9" as first digit indicates amounts
clustered just below approval thresholds ($9,999, $9,500, etc.) — a classic **rounding down** scheme.

### 2. Isolation Forest (ML Outlier Detection)
**What it does**: Uses scikit-learn's `IsolationForest` to score each transaction by how
"easy" it is to isolate from the rest of the data.

**Why it works**: Anomalous transactions are structurally different — fewer random splits
are needed to isolate them. A contamination rate of ~5% is typical for corporate ledgers.

**Implementation**:
- Log-transform amounts to handle right-skewed financial distributions
- Standardize with `StandardScaler`
- IsolationForest with 200 estimators for stability
- Normalize anomaly scores to 0–100 risk scale

**Red flag example**: A $750,000 payment to a consulting firm when all similar
payments are in the $5k–$20k range will score near 100.

### 3. Relative Size Factor (RSF) Analysis
**What it does**: RSF = Transaction Amount ÷ Median Amount for the same vendor.

**Why it works**: It normalizes for vendor-specific pricing. A $100k payment is suspicious
from a $10k/transaction office supply vendor — but normal from a law firm.

**Implementation**:
- Group by vendor, compute median and standard deviation
- Calculate RSF and Z-score per transaction
- Flag RSF > 3.0 (3× median) as anomalous

**Red flag example**: A vendor historically billing $5,000/month suddenly submits
a $75,000 invoice → RSF = 15 → immediate escalation.

### 4. Duplicate Transaction Detection
**What it does**: Flags any set of transactions sharing identical date + amount + vendor.

**Why it works**: Duplicate invoices are one of the most common billing fraud schemes.
The ACFE estimates organizations lose ~5% of revenue to fraud annually, with billing
fraud as the #1 asset misappropriation scheme.

**Implementation**:
- Groupby on [date, vendor, amount]
- Flag all members of groups with count > 1
- Surface estimated total overpayment exposure

**Red flag example**: Invoice INV-1042 and INV-1178 both charge $12,450.00
to "Meridian IT" on 2024-03-15 — one is likely fraudulent.
